**JS Scoping**

There are 4 kinds of scope in JS
  1. Block
  2. Local
  3. Function
  4. Strict

**Block**
1. let and const provide block scope in JS.
2. Variables defined {} block can not be access from outside.

**Local**
1. Variable declared within function become local to the function.
2. Local variables are created when function starts and deleted when the function is completed.
3. Except function var doesn't work as local variable.

**Function**
1. Variables declared with var, let, const are quite similar when declared inside a function.

**Strict**
1. Variable that has not been declared, it will automatically become a global variable. Strict mode will stop this incident.
