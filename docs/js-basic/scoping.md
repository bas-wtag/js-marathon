# Scoping
Scope refers to the current context of code, which determines the accessibility of variables. The two types of scope are local and global.

**Global variables** are those declared outside of a block.
**Local variables** are those declared inside of a block.

**var, let and const scoping**

var variables are function-scoped whereas let and const variables are block-scoped.

**Function Scoped**

Function Scoped means declaring a variable within a function. In that case, that variable cannot be accessible globally or outside the function.

**Block Scoped**

Block Scoped means declaring a variable within a block. That means a new, local scope is created from any kinds of block, including function blocks, if statements, and for and while loops.
