# Conditions

## If-else

- The `if` statement checks a condition and performs some action when that condition is true.
- In the case of that statement being `false`, instructions mentioned in the `else` block will execute.
- In between `if` and `else`, `else if` statements can be placed which will check the condition only when the previous statement in the chain is false.
- Both `if` and `else` can have multiple nested checks inside them.
- In simples cases the ternary operator can be used.

## switch-case

- `switch` statement iterates over some cases and evaluates an expression to execute some case specific operation.
- The values of the cases and the expression are compared to find a match.
- the cases can have a `default` case which will be executed when none of the cases match with the expression.
