# Constants

- Constants are declared using the `const` keyword.
- Constants are read-only. Their values cannot be changed or redeclared or reassigned.
- However, if the constant is an array or a function then the underlying elements in that array/function can be changed. But the actual object/array cannot be redeclared.
- Constants are block scoped. Meaning they exist only within the curly braces they were declared inside.
