# Constants

**JS Constants**

- A constant is a type of variable whose value cannot be changed.

- The `const` keyword was also introduced in the ES6 (ES2015) version to create constants. However, it does not define a constant value. It defines a constant reference to a value.

- What you CAN NOT do using `const`: Reassign a constant value, reassign a constant array, or reassign a constant object.

- What you CAN do using `const`: Change the elements of constant array, change the properties of constant object

- JavaScript const variables must be assigned a value when they are declared.
`const PI = 3.14159265359;`

- It is good practice to use uppercase for naming constants.

- As a general rule, always declare a variable with const unless you know that the value will change.

- Constants are block-scoped, much like variables declared using the `let` keyword.
