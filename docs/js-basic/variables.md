# Variables
In JS variables represent data. We can declare variables in 3 ways - var, let and const.

**Declaring Variables Using var**
* var is the oldest keyword for declaring variables.
* var variables can be redeclared and updated into the scope.
* The scope of a var variable is functional scope.
* var variables can be accessed without initialization as its default value is undefined.

**Declaring Variables Using let**
* let is newest version of var.
* let variables can be updated but can not be re-declared into the scope.
* The scope of a let variable is block-scope.
* let variables can not be accessed without initialization, as it returns an error.

**Declaring Variables Using const**
* const stands for constant.
* const has all the properties of let, except the user can not update it.
* const variables cannot be updated or re-declared into the scope.
* const variables cannot be accessed without initialization.
