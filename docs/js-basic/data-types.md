# Data Types

- Two types are there. Primitives and Objects
- As a loosely typed language, types are assigned dynamically.
- Primitives are immutable. Therefore every change is stored in different memory locations.
- Every call in javascript is a call by value except for objects. Objects are passed by reference and changes made at one place are reflected everywhere. But for primitive types, the original stays unaffected.
- ES6 has introduced a new primitive data type called `symbol`. But unlike other types, symbols are not automatically converted into strings.
