# Arrays

- Arrays in JS are ordered collections of items which can contain any type of data including objects and methods.
- Position of an item in an array can be found by using ArrayName.indexOf(item) syntax.
- Elements can be inserted into and deleted from an array in any position. Furthermore, arrays support push and pop operations which can insert and remove respectively from the last index.
- shift() and unshift() methods can be used to perform removal and insertion on the first index.
- slice(StartIndex, EndIndex) method can be used to copy a part of an array.
