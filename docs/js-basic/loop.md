**JS loop**

There are 3 kinds of loop in JS
i. for
ii. while
iii. do-while

**for**:
for loop works with 3 statements. 1st statement executes once before execution of the block. 2nd one is conditional block and last one is how the loop will executed.
"for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}"
**for in**
The JavaScript for in statement loops through the properties of an Object.
"for (key in object) {
  // code block to be executed
}"
**for of**
The JavaScript for of statement loops through the values of an iterable object.It lets you loop over iterable data structures such as Arrays, Strings, Maps, NodeLists, and more.
"for (variable of iterable) {
  // code block to be executed
}"
**while**
The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
"while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}"
**do while**
The do while loop is a variant of the while loop. This loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.
"do {
  // code block to be executed
}
while (condition);"
