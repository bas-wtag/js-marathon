# Functions

- Functions allows us to use a single piece of code in multiple places. They perform one specific task and are usually declared as

```
function functionOne(x, y) {
//
}
```

- Functions can have a return statement which stops any further execution and send some values back along.
- Functions have their own scope inside
- Functions can receive any objects or values as parameters.
- Functions can also be declared using this syntax:

```
const f1 = (x, y) => {
//
return;
}
```
